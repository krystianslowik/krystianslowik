# buenos aires!

I’m Krystian. I break things, fix them, and automate whatever survives. Backend, pipelines, AI/ML, support, infra — if it can be faster, smarter, or require less human involvement, I’ll probably touch it.

These days it’s mostly applied AI/ML — data in, models out, systems shipped. I work on automation, image-heavy pipelines, and turning AI into something practical for people who just want results.

If it’s about workflow automation, image analysis, or reducing manual work in the real world, I’m likely involved.

## and next?

Always learning, always exploring. Engineering management — maybe.  
I don’t like doing things twice. Unless it’s automation — then you do it once and never again.

Open to good ideas, weird tech, and building things that should have existed already.
