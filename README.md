# üíÉüèΩ buenos aires!

I'm **Krystian**, a tech enthusiast on a journey where becoming a developer is just one step, with a love for all things tech and problem-solving. I focus on bridging the gap between creative front-end design and efficient back-end solutions, always aiming to make tech accessible and fun.

## üöÄ a `bit` about me

I dive into both **frontend** and **backend** realms, always up for a challenge. From hitting UIs with **React** to architecting back-end systems with **TypeScript** and exploring **Kotlin**, I'm driven to deliver impactful results.

> **do not forget:** all about automation ‚Äî life's too short for repetitive tasks! ‚ö°

## üíª tech stack & toolbox

### Main Tools in my belt
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, SQL, Bash, HTML, CSS, YAML, JSON, PHP. I forget some prolly, so ask if needed.
- **Frontend**: React, Angular, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, PHP & bit Kotlin
- **DevOps & cloud**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
- **Automation & testing**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Playwright, Selenium
- **Others I've worked with**: MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Azure Functions, GraphQL, Firebase.

### Curious Explorations
I've also dipped my toes into **Kotlin**, **Java**, **Go**, **Swift**, **Ruby**, **C#**, **R**, **Perl**, and experimented with tools like **neo4j**, **WireMock**, **Kafka**, **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Cassandra**, and **Prometheus**. Constantly learning, forever curious.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Love Doing
- Crafting sleek and interactive UIs with **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind**.
- Building solid back-end solutions with **Node.js**, **PHP**, and **AWS Lambda**.
- Creating **CI/CD** pipelines with **GitHub Actions** for smoother workflows.
- Designing robust environments with **Playwright** for effective testing.

## üå± my opensourcers
- **GH Action**: [Docker Compose Health Check GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-compose-health-check)
- **Kotlin**: [Echoserve (WireMock)](https://github.com/jaracogmbh/echoserve)
- **TypeScript (library)**: [Trusted Shops SDK](https://github.com/krystianslowik/trustedshops-typescript-sdk)

## üåç Beyond the Code
When I'm not coding, you can find me cruising on my **eBike** (shoutout to Bosch engines!), enjoying some **chilling**, experimenting with new **recipes**, or **taking care of my bonsai trees**. I'm also brushing up on my **chess skills**‚Äîalways up for a challenge!
