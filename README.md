# buenos aires!

i'm Krystian, a tech head who breaks, fixes, and automates everything in sight. ai/ml, dev, backend, pipelines, support, whatever—if it can be made faster, smarter, or lazier, i'll mess with it.

these days:  
deep into ai/ml for biology and lab automation, digital pathology, and making sense of real-world data. building and training models, wrangling data (lots of images), deploying stuff that actually runs, making ai work for people who don't care how it works. if it's sample recognition or workflow automation, i'm probably in.

## outside work

experimental cooking (duck, pierogi, whatever’s left in the fridge)  
chess (still bad, still playing)  
ai/ml tinkering, random automation, side projects nobody asked for  

## and next?

always exploring new tech, not done learning. engineering management? maybe.  
don’t do things twice—unless you can automate it, then you only do it once.
