# 💃🏽 buenos aires!  

i'm **Krystian**, a tech enthusiast who's been everywhere and touched everything. developer? yeah, sure, but i break, fix, automate, and optimize—because why stop at just coding?    

## 🚀 a `bit` about me  

frontend? backend? devops? all of it. if it runs, i'll figure it out. been deep in **typescript**, **kotlin**, and **php**, but always poking around new stacks. building sleek ui, crafting backend magic, or automating workflows—whatever makes tech work smarter, not harder.  

> **do not forget:** automate everything. life's too short to do things twice. ⚡  

## 💻 tech stack & toolbox  

### main tools in my belt  
- **languages**: typescript, javascript, python, kotlin, php, sql, bash, yaml, json, swift, ruby, go, java, c#, r, perl. yes, i’ve touched them all.  
- **frontend**: react, angular, next.js, tailwind, twig (yeah, not just jsx).  
- **backend**: node.js, express, nest.js, php, laravel, symfony, kotlin, spring boot, graphql, rest.  
- **devops & cloud**: docker, kubernetes, aws, azure, terraform, ansible, cloudflare.  
- **automation & testing**: github actions, jenkins, selenium, playwright, wiremock, pact, postman.  
- **databases & storage**: mysql, postgresql, mongodb, redis, firebase, elasticsearch, cassandra, neo4j.  
- **message brokers & event-driven**: rabbitmq, kafka, mqtt, websockets.  

### curious explorations  
i've played around with **haskell**, **rust**, **scala**, **clojure**, **erlang**, and some weird edge-case stuff like **prolog**. messed with **prometheus**, **loki**, **jaeger**, **openapi**, **keycloak**, **vault**, and **argocd** just to see what’s up. i like tinkering.  

## 🛠️ what i love doing  
- crafting **sleek ui** with **react**, **next.js**, and **tailwind**.  
- building **robust backends** with **node.js**, **kotlin**, and **php**.  
- automating **ci/cd** pipelines with **github actions** and **jenkins**.  
- testing and mocking apis with **pact**, **playwright**, and **wiremock**.  
- setting up **scalable infra** with **docker**, **kubernetes**, and **terraform**.
